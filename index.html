            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have been engaged in infectious disease research, particularly malaria, since my undergraduate studies in Ecuador. During that time, I characterized local Plasmodium falciparum populations, producing the first report on the genetic structure of P. falciparum in the region. Additionally, I identified P. falciparum parasites with hrp2 gene deletions, which cause false negatives in rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria.

For my Ph.D., I continued studying hrp2 deletions, examining their prevalence and evolution across various malaria-endemic countries. This work has resulted in multiple publications as both first and co-author. I also developed and validated a digital PCR (dPCR) protocol for detecting hrp2/hrp3 deletions, which has been successfully implemented in countries such as Ethiopia, Thailand, and many other countries. In addition, I have trained personnel and students from Ethiopia and other regions in molecular diagnostic techniques.

After earning my Ph.D., I conducted postdoctoral research in Dr. Pilar Pérez-Romero’s lab at the University of Notre Dame, where I focused on identifying monoclonal antibodies against cytomegalovirus (CMV) from patient samples. These antibodies are being evaluated for their potential as preventive or therapeutic agents.

I am currently working as an independent researcher, continuing to pursue scientific projects in infectious diseases while exploring new collaborative opportunities. With extensive experience in molecular epidemiology, diagnostic development, and translational immunology, I bring a resourceful and adaptable approach to research. I am open to expanding my expertise beyond my current areas of focus and am well-prepared to design and lead rigorous scientific studies.

Please feel free to reach out if you’d like more information or have any questions about my background. I'm based in Austin, Texas, on an OPT-STEM extension through 2027.</p>
