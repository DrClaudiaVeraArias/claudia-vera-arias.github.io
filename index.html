            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have been engaged in infectious disease research, particularly malaria, since my undergraduate studies in Ecuador. During that time, I characterized local <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> populations, producing the first report on the genetic structure of <em>P. falciparum</em> in the region. Additionally, I identified <em>P. falciparum</em> parasites with <em>hrp2</em> gene deletions, which cause false negatives in rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria.</p>

            <p>During my Ph.D., I continued studying <em>hrp2</em> deletions, examining their prevalence and evolution across various malaria-endemic countries. This work has resulted in multiple publications as both first and co-author. I also developed, validated and helped to implement a digital PCR (dPCR) protocol for detecting <em>hrp2/hrp3</em> deletions, which has been successfully implemented in countries such as Ethiopia, Thailand, and many others. In addition, I have trained personnel and students from Ethiopia and other regions in molecular diagnostic techniques.</p>

            <p>After earning my Ph.D., I conducted postdoctoral research in Dr. Pilar Pérez-Romero’s lab at the University of Notre Dame, where I focused on identifying monoclonal antibodies against cytomegalovirus (CMV) from patient samples. These antibodies are being evaluated for their potential as preventive or therapeutic agents.</p>

            <p>I am currently working as an independent researcher, continuing to pursue scientific projects in infectious diseases while exploring new collaborative opportunities. With extensive experience in molecular epidemiology, diagnostic development, and translational immunology, I bring a resourceful and adaptable approach to research. I am open to expanding my expertise beyond my current areas of focus and am well-prepared to design and lead rigorous scientific studies.</p>

            <p>Please feel free to reach out if you’d like more information or have any questions about my background. I'm based in Austin, Texas, on an OPT-STEM extension through 2027.</p>
