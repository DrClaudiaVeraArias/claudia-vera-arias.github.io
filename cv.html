      <li>Detected and isolated HCMV monoclonal antibodies from seropositive patients using flow cytometry and PCR.</li>
      <li>Developed monoclonal antibody therapies targeting HCMV for use in immunocompromised patients.</li>
      <li>Standardized and optimized cell culture, PCR, and Western blot techniques to support HCMV research and antibody production.</li>

      <li>Detection of <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> that carries the deletion of the <em>hrp2</em> gene and <em>hrp3</em> gene through molecular tools like digital PCR (dPCR) in America and Africa.</li>
      <li>Comparison of molecular <em>hrp2</em> gene and <em>hrp3</em> detection methods. Three PCR variations (nested PCR, quantitative PCR, and digital PCR) were compared to determine which one was the best.</li>
      <li>Standardization of several protocols in many digital PCR platforms. As a result, I developed a protocol that takes less than an hour to detect the deletion of <em>hrp2</em> gene and <em>hrp3</em> that can be used in the field.</li>
      <li>Standardization and testing of the new digital PCR platform LOAA (OPTOLANE) as part of the prototype try to validate the dPCR Plataforma LOAA.</li>
      <li>Validation of the electronica microscopy (Noul) in Ethiopia.</li>
      <li>Trained international research personnel and students on-site at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</li>

    <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
    <p><strong>University of Notre Dame, IN, Aug 2019 - May 2024</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Supported a variety of undergraduate biology courses focused on developing students’ research skills, critical thinking, and technical proficiency. Led laboratory sections and mentored students in the Research Experience in Biology course across several semesters, guiding semester-long research projects on topics such as antibiotic resistance and protein-protein interactions in </em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. Taught core techniques including DNA isolation, PCR, electrophoresis, bacterial transformation, microscopy, and data analysis. Also contributed to Biology II: Molecules to Ecosystems, Introductory Biology M2E Lectures, and the Biological Investigations Laboratory, helping students master fundamental biological concepts and skills. Consistently received excellent course evaluations, ranging from 4.4 to 4.9 out of 5.0..</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Quito, Jan 2017 - May 2019</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed and delivered course content to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of microorganisms, including their diversity, classification, structure, and physiology. Emphasized the ecological, industrial, medical, and environmental significance of microbes through lectures and hands-on laboratory sessions. Guided students in mastering core microbiological techniques such as isolation, culturing, and analysis of microorganisms. Received excellent evaluations from students, reflecting strong engagement and effective teaching.</li>
