      <ul>
        <li>Detection of <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> that carries the deletion of the <em>hrp2</em> gene and <em>hrp3</em> gene through molecular tools like digital PCR (dPCR) in America and Africa.</li>
        <li>Comparison of molecular <em>hrp2</em> gene and <em>hrp3</em> detection methods. Three PCR variations (nested PCR, quantitative PCR, and digital PCR) were compared to determine which one was the best.</li>
        <li>Standardization of several protocols in many digital PCR platforms. As a result, I developed a protocol that takes less than an hour to detect the deletion of <em>hrp2</em> gene and <em>hrp3</em> that can be used in the field.</li>
        <li>Standardization and testing of the new digital PCR platform LOAA (OPTOLANE) as part of the prototype try to validate the dPCR Plataforma LOAA.</li>
        <li>Validation of the electronica microscopy (Noul) in Ethiopia.</li>
        <li>Trained international research personnel and students on-site at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</li>
      </ul>

            <p class="position">Teaching Assistant</p>
      <p class="institution">University of Notre Dame (2019‚Äì2024)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assisted in multiple undergraduate biology courses, including Research Experience in Biology, Biology II: Molecules to Ecosystems, Intro Biology M2E, and Biological Investigation Laboratory.</li>
        <li>Guided students through authentic research projects on topics such as antibiotic resistance, transcriptomics, and protein-protein interactions in <em>M. Tuberculosis</em>.</li>
        <li>Taught and supervised lab activities involving molecular biology, microbiology, PCR, electrophoresis, bacterial transformation, microscopy, and fieldwork.</li>
        <li>Contributed to curriculum development, including building a database of exam questions for core biology lectures.</li>
        <li>Courses taught ranged from 22 to 74 students per semester, consistently earning high student evaluation scores (4.5 to 4.9 out of 5.0).</li>
        <li>Emphasized student development skills in experimental design, data analysis, and scientific communication.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Molecular characterization of <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> population in Ecuador using neutral microsatellites located in 6 chromosomes of the parasite.</li>
        <li>Organization and conduction of cohorts in Ecuador. The goal of the cohort was to collect all the information on the malaria endemic areas and the collection of samples for the posterior analysis and determination of <em>Plasmodium</em> sp., molecular characterization with neutral microsatellites, and <em>hrp2</em> status determination.</li>
        <li>Laboratory functioning by managing budgets, allocating resources, and maintaining accurate records. Supervised and trained personnel and students in molecular techniques. I was in charge of equipment maintenance and inventory management. In addition, I contributed to project management and research support through technical expertise and data management.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="position">Undergraduate Research Assistant</p>
      <p class="institution">PUCE (2010‚Äì2015)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Molecular characterization of <em>P. falciparum</em> population in Northwest Ecuador using neutral microsatellites located in 6 chromosomes of the parasite. Ecuadorian <em>P. falciparum</em> circulated in Northwest Ecuador was almost identical to parasites circulating the Pacific Coast of Peru in 2000 and to an ancestral <em>P. falciparum</em> sample collected in the Ecuadorian Coast in 1990. Additionally, no <em>hrp2/3</em> deletion was found.</li>
