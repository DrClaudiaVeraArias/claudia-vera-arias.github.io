    <h2>Research Experience</h2>
    <p class="position">Idependent Researcher</p>
    <ul>
      <li>II independently lead and contribute to research projects in molecular biology, microbiology, and infectious diseases, with a focus on diagnostics, antimicrobial resistance, and data-driven problem solving. I collaborate with academic and international partners, provide scientific consulting, and continue publishing peer-reviewed research.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="position">Postdoctoral Researcher</p>
    <p class="institution">University of Notre Dame / Eck Institute for Global Health, IN (2024–2025)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detected and isolated HCMV monoclonal antibodies from seropositive patients using flow cytometry and PCR.</li>
      <li>Developed monoclonal antibody therapies targeting HCMV for use in immunocompromised patients.</li>
      <li>Standardized and optimized cell culture, PCR, and Western blot techniques to support HCMV research and antibody production.</li>
      <li>Mice immunization as part of the develop of a vaccine for HCMV.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Detection of <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> that carries the deletion of the <em>hrp2</em> gene and <em>hrp3</em> gene through molecular tools like digital PCR (dPCR) in America and Africa.</li>
      <li>Comparison of molecular <em>hrp2</em> gene and <em>hrp3</em> detection methods. Three PCR variations (nested PCR, quantitative PCR, and digital PCR) were compared to determine which one was the best.</li>
      <li>Standardization of several protocols in many digital PCR platforms. As a result, I developed a protocol that takes less than an hour to detect the deletion of <em>hrp2</em> gene and <em>hrp3</em> that can be used in the field.</li>
      <li>Standardization and testing of the new digital PCR platform LOAA (OPTOLANE) as part of the prototype try to validate the dPCR Plataforma LOAA.</li>
      <li>Validation of the electronica microscopy (Noul) in Ethiopia.</li>
      <li>Trained international research personnel and students on-site at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</li>

The goal of the cohort was to collect all the information on the malaria endemic areas and the collection of samples for the posterior analysis and determination of Organization and conduction of cohorts in Ecuador. The goal of the cohort was to collect all the information on the malaria endemic areas and the collection of samples for the posterior analysis and determination of <em>Plasmodium</em> sp., molecular characterization with neutral microsatellites, and <em>hrp2</em> status determinationPlasmodium sp., molecular characterization with neutral microsatellites, and <em>hrp2</em> status determination.</li>
      <li>Laboratory functioning by managing budgets, allocating resources, and maintaining accurate records. Supervise and train personnel and students in molecular techniques. I was in charge of equipment maintenance and inventory management. In addition, I contribute to project management and research support through technical expertise and data management.</li>

      <li>Molecular characterization of <em>P. falciparum</em> population in Northwest Ecuador using neutral microsatellites located in 6 chromosomes of the parasite. Ecuadorian <em>P. falciparum</em> circulated in Northwest Ecuador was almost identical to parasites circulating the Pacific Coast of Peru in 2000 and to an ancestral P. falciparum sample collected in the Ecuadorian Coast in 1990. Additionally, no <em>hrp2/3</em> deletion was found.</li>
